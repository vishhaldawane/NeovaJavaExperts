	 		1. Abstraction
	 				hiding the complexity of an object
	 				
	 				using these functions to utilize the object
	 				
	 				it is the "WHAT IS?" part of an object
	 				
	 				What is an ATM Object? - getting the cash - Farmer - 
	 				
	 				a. data abstraction - how much cash is there in the ATM?
	 				b. procedural abstraction - cameraClick(), soundRec(), log(), lock() releaseIt()
	 				c. class abstraction
	 				
	 				Kite kite1 = new Kite();
	 				kite1.fly();
	 				kite1.kiteFight();
	 				
	 				what is your father ?  - he is a Surgeon
	 				
	 				
	 				USAGE
	 				
	 				
	 		2. Encapsulation
	 				coding for the complexity of the object
	 				
	 				binding of data with concerned function = contract
	 				
	 				it is the "HOW IS IT?" part of an object
	 				
	 				How the cash is dispensed??? - ATM Engineer
	 				
	 				class Kite { ....}
	 				class Flight {... }
	 				class Person { ....}
	 				
	 				CODE for the USAGE
